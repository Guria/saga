# Saga

Backend for [Vega](https://github.com/vegapublish/vega)

# About the name

Saga is an abbreviation of Sagittarus A\* which is the radio source likely to be the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy ‚ôê

# Getting started

## Prerequisites
- MongoDB v3.x or newer
- Node.js v8.x or newer
- npm v6.x or newer

To setup a new instance of `saga`, start by cloning this repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/VegaPublish/saga.git
```

## Configure oauth for root user claiming
As a part of the initial setup, a root user needs to be added to the system.
In order to claim the root user, a oauth config file must be created in `./config/oauth.json` (take a look at `./config/oauth.fallback.json` for an example.

## First setup
Once oauth is configured you can proceed with first time setup. Before you continue, make sure the server is running in the background with `npm run start`.
`npm run setup`. This will guide you through the process of claiming a root user and setting up the default venue.

## Adding a new journal or conference (a.k.a. _venue_)
After first setup, you can create new venues by running `npm run create-venue`. This will guide you through the necessary steps.

## Running the server
`npm run start`
